What if error messages were compelling to read?
-----------------------------------------------

Blog explaining the code is [here](http://blog.turing.io/2015/01/18/what-we-ve-got-here-is-an-error-to-communicate/).
(or will be once it's merged).

A screenshot of the code rendering an `ArgumentError`.

This is a proof of concept
--------------------------

This isn't fit for real-world use.
If there is resonance in the community, I'll probably try to make it a real gem.
I'll have some time to do that during my next braeak in late march 2015.

Inspirations:
-------------

* I think initially this was inspired by Sarah Gray's talk at Software Craftsmanship North America:
  [Visualizing Enumerable: Own Abstract Concepts Through Physicalization](https://vimeo.com/54860297)
* Got to thinking about it again with Kerri Miller, conversing at DCamp,
  and then at Ruby Conf, she created [chatty_exceptions](https://github.com/kerrizor/chatty_exceptions)
  which is in this same domain.
* Charlie Sommerville's [better_errors](https://rubygems.org/gems/better_errors)
  gem gives you a nice interface like this for Rails.
