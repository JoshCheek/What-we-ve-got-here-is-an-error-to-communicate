What would it be like to have better error messages?
====================================================

This is a proof of concept to explore the question.
See if there's any resonance in the community, etc.
This isn't fit for real-world use.
I might try to make it into a real gem if people get excited about it.

I realized that I do this a lot, even still.
I've gotten very good at glancing at the structure
of the text on the screen and knowing what the error is and where to look.

But sometimes it's still hard to find that one piece of info I need from it.
Which means sometimes I just jump to where I expect it to be, figuring if I look at it for a moment,
I'll see it and fix it. This is usually true, but if I'm not particularly on that day,
I can utterly misunderstand the problem.

For me, this is a conjunction of bad UI and a brain that operates a certain way.
I'd love a more patient brain that didn't feel a little overwhelmed every time it
looks at a stacktrace, but locating needles in haystacks is a skill unto itself,
and I shouldn't have to spend my mental energy parsing the error to try and figure
out what it's attempting to tell me. It should just be obvious.

Inspirations:
-------------

I think initially this was inspired by something Sarah Gray mentioned,
or said she wanted during her talk at Software Craftsmanship North America.

Got to thinking about it again witih Kerri Miller, conversing at DCamp,
and then at Ruby Conf, she created https://github.com/kerrizor/chatty_exceptions
which is in this same arena.
